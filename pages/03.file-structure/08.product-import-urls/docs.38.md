Pacemaker Community comes with a dedicated product URL rewrite import and the apropriate command `import:products:url` therefore. You can find more information about how to invoke the command in the [Usage](/getting-started/usage) section.

In general the filename for the dedicated product URL rewrite import **MUST** match the following pattern `<PREFIX>_<FILENAME>_<COUNTER>.csv`, whereas the default `<PREFIX>` is `url-rewrite`, the `<FILENAME>` is a combination of date and time like `20190608-114344`, and the `<COUNTER>` is a consecutive number with two digits starting with `01`. This results in a filename like `url-rewrite_20190608-114344_01.csv`. Additionally an apropriate `.ok` file is needed.

> ATTENTION: Please be aware that the three parts **MUST** be separated with an underscore "_" as there is meaning for the bunch import behind its structure.

The CSV file with the attributes for the Magento 2 CE/EE consists of the following columns

| Column Name      | Type     | Description                                                                               | Example      |
|:-----------------|:---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------|
| sku              | varchar  | The product SKU to import the tier price for                                              |     `24-MB01`|
| store_view_code  | varchar  | The specific store view(s) for attribute translations. If blank, the row provides the data for the admin store view. | `default` |
| categories       | varchar  | The comma (,) separated list with related categories, URL rewrites has to be created for  | `Default Category/Gear,Default Category/Gear/Bags` |
