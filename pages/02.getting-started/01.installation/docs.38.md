!! ATTENTION: As of version 3.8.0, the structure of the configuration has changed considerably and the previous configuration files can no longer be used. In order to avoid complex adjustments of the configuration, version 3.8.0 merged the configuration for all entities into one, but dedicated overwriting of individual settings is now possible, e. g. for the log level.

Depending on the requirements different installation options are available.

### Install as Composer Project

To install the package as a new project, assuming composer is available, open a console and enter

```sh
composer create-project techdivision/import-cli-simple --no-dev
```

This will clone the repository from the internal Gitlab and install the M2IF, that's all.

### Install as Composer Library

The second option, and in most Magento 2 projects the preferred way, will be the installation as a Composer library. For example, if you want to deliver it with your Magento 2 project, simply add

```json
{
  "require": {
    "techdivision/import-cli-simple" : "3.8.*"
  }
}
```

to your Magento 2 `composer.json` file. Then run

```sh
composer update
```

from your Magento 2 root directory and your're all setup.

### Use as PHAR

The last, but for sure not the worst installation option, is to download the latest PHAR from our [Github](https://github.com/techdivision/import-cli-simple/releases) release page and make it executable, e. g. with `wget`

```sh
wget https://github.com/techdivision/import-cli-simple/releases/download/3.8.12/import-cli-simple.phar \
  && sudo chmod +x import-cli-simple.phar
```

To install the PHAR in your actual Magento 2 installation, move it to `<MAGENTO-ROOT>/bin/import-cli-simple.phar` or, to install it globally, to `/usr/bin/import-cli-simple.phar`. Now you ready to use it.

### Add Missing Indexes

As the M2IF functionality differs from the Magento 2 standard, for performance reasons, it is necessary to manually add some necessary indexes. To do that, open a MySQL command line, connect to your MySQL server instance and enter the following SQL statement
 
```sql
ALTER TABLE `eav_attribute_option_value` ADD INDEX `EAV_ATTRIBUTE_OPTION_VALUE_VALUE` (`value` ASC); \
  ALTER TABLE `catalog_product_entity_int` ADD INDEX `CATALOG_PRODUCT_ENTITY_INT_VALUE` (`value` ASC); \
  ALTER TABLE `catalog_product_entity_varchar` ADD INDEX `CATALOG_PRODUCT_ENTITY_VARCHAR_VALUE` (`value` ASC); \
  ALTER TABLE `catalog_product_entity_decimal` ADD INDEX `CATALOG_PRODUCT_ENTITY_DECIMAL_VALUE` (`value` ASC); \
  ALTER TABLE `catalog_product_entity_datetime` ADD INDEX `CATALOG_PRODUCT_ENTITY_DATETIME_VALUE` (`value` ASC); \
  ALTER TABLE `url_rewrite` ADD INDEX `URL_REWRITE_ENTITY_ID` (`entity_id` ASC); \
  ALTER TABLE `url_rewrite` ADD INDEX `URL_REWRIRE_ENTITY_TYPE_ENTITY_ID` (`entity_id` ASC, `entity_type` ASC); \
  ALTER TABLE `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery` ADD INDEX `CATALOG_PRODUCT_ENTITY_MEDIA_GALLERY_VALUE` (`value`);
```

When using the Magic 360 [component](/components/3rd-party-components), addtionally the following indexes has to be added
