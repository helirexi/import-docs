!! ATTENTION: As of version 3.8.0, the structure of the configuration has changed considerably and the previous configuration files can no longer be used. In order to avoid complex adjustments of the configuration, version 3.8.0 merged the configuration for all entities into one, but dedicated overwriting of individual settings is now possible, e. g. for the log level.

Pacemaker Community - provides components to build import solutions for Magento 2

The objective of Pacemaker Community is to provide a fully functional replacement for the Magento 2 standard import functionality with nearly 100 % CSV file compatibility. In contrast to other approaches, the framework is not build as a Magento 2 extension, although it has no dependencies to other frameworks like Symfony, Laravel or others. Instead, it provides independent components, that can be tied together as needed, by adding them as composer dependency.

Our fully functional CLI implementation should will be a good start to show you how Pacemaker Community can be used and customized to your needs. For more information, have a look at the [Pacemaker - Community Console Tool](https://github.com/techdivision/import-cli-simple) repository.
